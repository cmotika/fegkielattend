0. Verify that all tests pass for the latest version in the GIT.

http://delphino.net:8888/job/FeG/

1. Make a local copy of the subdomain reg.feg-kiel.de-Server.

2. Copy the following files (from GIT) to the feg-kiel.de-Server (reg.-Subdomain):

attend.php
attend-admin.php
attend-code.php
attend-functions.php
attend-login.php
index.php

Do NOT copy the following file:

attend.cfg.php

... as it contains the configuration.


3. Ensure the following directories exist:
admin
captcha
data

4. Verify that in the attend.cfg.php file of the prod server, the following entries exist:
$test_enabled = false;
$mail_to = "fegkiel@mailde";

5. Set the following TAG in the GIT:
deployed-YYYY-MM-DDx

where 	YYYY is the year, e.g., 20202
	MM is the month, e.g., 09
	DD is the day, e.g., 02
	x is an optional identifier for several deployments of one day. For the first deployment x is omitted, for the second x=a, the third x=b, the fourth x=c, and so on.

6. Inform the others of the technical team of the FeG by email.

7. Once you have verified, everything works as expected, delete the local copy (from 1.).

8. You successfully deployed!
